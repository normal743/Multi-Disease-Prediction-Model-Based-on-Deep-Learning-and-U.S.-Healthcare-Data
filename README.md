# Multi-Disease-Prediction-Model-Based-on-Deep-Learning-and-U.S.-Healthcare-Data
Abstract
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as angina, overweight, diabetes, and hypertension, place a heavy burden on global health and contribute to a significant portion of global mortality. This project developed a multi-disease prediction model based on US healthcare data (NHANES) designed to predict an individualâ€™s risk of developing multiple diseases . The model employs machine learning techniques including K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) as well as deep learning and AutoML methods. The performance of these models is evaluated by various metrics and F1 scores. Additionally, to better demonstrate the prediction results, we also built a small web application based on the deep learning model using flask that has an average accuracy of roughly 78%. We believe that this model can be further upgraded in the open-source community and subsequent research to contribute to early disease prevention, precision medicine, and improved public health.
Keywords: Non-communicable diseases, multi-disease prediction, deep learning, machine learning, U.S. healthcare data, disease prevention, precision medicine, public health.


The automated neural network trained model is too large to upload for a short time in google drive. Learn more at https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon .and the code is provided
